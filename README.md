wmarticle
=========

The wmarticle stylesheet and javascript module are an attempt to create a nicely looking style for print. It is inspired by the features found in LaTeX and triggered by the idea that most of these features are also supported in today's CSS3 and HTML5.

Usage
-----

Open `wmarticle.html` in a webbrowser or have a look at the online version at <a href="http://wannesm.be/wmarticle/">http://wannesm.be/wmarticle/</a>.
